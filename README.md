####Intrusion Detection System Using Machine Learning

#Overview

This project involves the development of an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using machine learning
techniques to enhance network security. The system leverages supervised learning algorithms, including
Random Forest, Decision Tree, and XGBoost, to detect and classify network intrusions effectively. 
Utilizing the KDD Cup 1999 dataset, a benchmark for intrusion detection, the project preprocesses 
network traffic data to identify and categorize various types of attacks and normal connections. 
The IDS achieves robust performance by analyzing feature importance, visualizing metrics such as
accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and reducing false positives to improve reliability. 
By implementing this system, the project demonstrates a significant step towards proactive network
threat detection and mitigation.

#Technologies Used

The project is implemented in Python with the use of libraries such as
Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and XGBoost.
The dataset used for training and evaluation is the widely recognized
KDD Cup 1999 dataset, which simulates real-world network traffic scenarios
with labeled attacks and benign traffic.

Results and Future Enhancements

The system demonstrates high accuracy in detecting network anomalies, achieving an accuracy of [insert value]% on the test dataset. Additionally, it identifies and classifies network intrusions with high precision and recall, reducing false positives and enhancing interpretability through feature importance analysis. Future work includes integrating unsupervised learning for anomaly detection, deploying the IDS in real-time network environments, and scaling to larger datasets for improved generalization.
